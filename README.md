hey this project is one of the tasks that are given in Angela Yu's Python Course. 
i ,indeed,did copycat some parts that i didn't understand, but for the most of the time i couraged myself to do the job on my own.
the codes are completely the products of my knowledge on algorithms and data structures.
i only push notable projects and that are fun to use.
